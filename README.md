# Simulation-of-Two-Wheeled-Robot-Stability-A-Comparative-Study-of-PID-vs-LQR-Controller-Systems-

This work performs a comparative analysis of the efficiency of Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) and Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) controllersin stabilizing inverted pendulums. The study investigates the utilization of linear acceleration and angular rate data obtained from an MPU as inputs to the controllers, which subsequently output torque to the motor. This torque determines both the speed and direction of the wheel, critical for maintaining balance in the inverted pendulum system. Through simulations conducted in MATLAB, various scenarios are examined, including the effect of different loads on the system's stability and performance. The results reveal insights into the effectiveness of PID and LQR controllers in different conditions, shedding light on their respective strengths and limitations in stabilizing inverted pendulums.
